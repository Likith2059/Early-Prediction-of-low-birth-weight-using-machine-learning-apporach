EARLY PREDICTION OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (LBW) CASES USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
 
 
 
 
 
 OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this application is to investigate a specific problem of whether it is valuable or not to use machine learning techniques to predict whether the baby belongs to Low Birth Weight or not belongs to Low Birth Weight.


ABSTRACT:
Low Birth weight (LBW) acts as an indicator of sickness in new born babies. LBW is closely associated with infant mortality as well as various health outcomes later in life. Various studies show strong correlation between maternal health during pregnancy and the child’s birth weight. This manuscript exploits machine learning techniques to gain useful information from health indicators of pregnant women for early detection of potential LBW cases. The forecasting problem has been reformulated as a classiﬁcation problem between LBW and NOT-LBW classes using supervised Machine learning for LBW detection as a binary machine classiﬁcation problem. Expectedly, the proposed model achieved better accuracy. Indian health care data was used to construct decision rules to be extrapolated to predictive health care in smart cities. A screening tool based on the decision model is developed to assist health care professionals in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OBG).
